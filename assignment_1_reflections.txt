This file is in a git repository but the changes have n't been committed.
I have uncommitted changes in this file but I don't know how to commit them.

I am getting the hang of this. But why is there nothing to commit?
I have made changes to a file in the repository. Git-Plus says there is nothing to commit.

This is not really behaving like I would hope. I don't think it's a bug ...
but why isn't git-plus in atom core if it is stable?

"Nothing to commit."

"Nothing to commit!" Why is there nothing to commit?
I haven't added the file? But I just did
Why is there nothing to commit?
Git-plus is broken ... possible
Why is there nothing to commit?
My changes are not saved to the file... but they are saved!

It works after I add the file then commit.
But I should only have to add the file once, then I just save and commit!
FUUUUU!

"Nothing to commit."

Maybe it is doing commit on save?
But the changes don't appear in git log.

"Nothing to commit"

charlesramm (master +) reflections $ git status
On branch master
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage)

	modified:   lesson_2_reflections.txt


  charlesramm (master *+) reflections $ git commit -am "fuck it all"
  [master 8af6e54] fuck it all
   1 file changed, 25 insertions(+)

Now is there something to commit? no

Maybe I don't know how to use git
Maybe I forgot to save?

now I know how to commit with a keyboard shortcut! It only took me
... 54 lines! amazing.

Now I should learn the difference between commit, add, commit -a and "commit -a ."
