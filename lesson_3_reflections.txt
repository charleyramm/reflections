git remote
shows one remote called 'origin' already so I can't do 
git remote add origin https://github.com/charleyramm/reflections.git

This isn't mentioned in the course video at

Oh - I was in the asteroids directory.

git push origin master

* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository might be good for sharing work with others, working collaboratively, or pushing to a live server.

git pull origin master

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- I might be working on the branch and not ready to merge somebody elses changes.
- I'm a rough tough rough ridin cowboy.
- I want my code to stand still while I edit it, yeahaw!

* Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When 
would you use one instead of another?

- A fork is githubs method of cloning repositories and crediting the 
original author. It is sometimes a convenient way of quickly sharing 
changes to a codebase without requiring authorisation to change the 
original.

- clone is Gits way of creating a copy of an entire repo including its 
commit history. It also sets up a remote called origin automatically. 
When I am going to work independently on a codebase I will clone it to 
my own machine. Later my changes can be pushed or pulled back to the 
'origin' repository. If my changes are out of sync I can pull the latest 
version and merge them locally before pushing to origin.

- Branches are labels for commits. When you checkout a branch it becomes 
the HEAD commit and new commits will have it as a parent. Branches are 
good for separating different coding efforts. I might keep my 
experiments in separate branches so that I can freely change the code 
without fear of breaking the master branch.
