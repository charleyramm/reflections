git remote
shows one remote called 'origin' already so I can't do 
git remote add origin https://github.com/charleyramm/reflections.git

This isn't mentioned in the course video at 
https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-ud775/l-3105028581/e-3073678893/m-3073678894

Oh - I was in the asteroids directory.
...
git push origin master

* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository might be good for sharing work with others, working collaboratively, or pushing to a live server.
