git remote
shows one remote called 'origin' already so I can't do 
git remote add origin https://github.com/charleyramm/reflections.git

This isn't mentioned in the course video at

Oh - I was in the asteroids directory.
...
git push origin master

* When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

A remote repository might be good for sharing work with others, working collaboratively, or pushing to a live server.

git pull origin master

* Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having 
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

- I might be working on the branch and not ready to merge somebody elses changes.
- I'm a rough tough rough ridin cowboy.
- I want my code to stand still while I edit it, yeahaw!
